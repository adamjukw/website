        In the beggining God created Adam.

        <br>
        I'm still here, chillin and developing my milleniums worth of wisdom.
<br>
        <br>
        As the world becomes more and more online I decided that it was time to force myself to become engulfed with as much learning as I can. I started with python but hated where the execution of my code took place so I switched to building a website as my launching point. As I learn more I will add projects and enhance the site.
        <br>
        <br>
        It will also be an embodyment of myself since the sites functional purpose, at this point is the promotion of ADAMJKW.
        <br><br>
        Thanks for taking the time to look around. I hope you enjoy.
