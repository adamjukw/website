        I'm still here, chillin and developing my milleniums worth of <a id="kenny" href="https://kennymoc.xyz/index.html" target="_blank">wisdom</a>.
<br>
        <br>
        As the world becomes more and more online I decided that it was time to force myself to become engulfed with as much learning as I can. I started with python but hated where the execution of my code took place so I switched to building a website as my launching point. As I learn more I will add projects and enhance the site.
        <br>
        <br>
        I suppose it will also be an embodyment of myself since the sites functional purpose, at this point is the promotion of ADAMJKW in my search for SEO glory.

        Thanks for taking the time to look around. I hope you enjoy.
