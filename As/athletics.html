        The first sport that Adam commited to was Rugby where he played most of his games for the Clan. Unfortunatley rugby didn't like him as he ended up with 5 concussions in 7 months.

      <img src="../images/hop.jpeg" alt="brain" width="200px" style="float:left;">Realising that his brain was something that he should stop destroying Adam <br>switched his focus to Nordic Racing. He has only been skiing for 2 years and<br> racing for 1. Adam is excited to see where the next season will take him.
