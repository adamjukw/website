                <p>From a young age Adamjkw has been involved in just about every sport he could. He focused on Rugby until after knocking his IQ down a bit with several concussions, he switched to pursuing nordic skiing as his primairy disipline.</p>

                <p>The ability to think, especially criticly is a skill Adamjkw values above most else. That is why he often talks first and thinks later as it forces him to think quickly.  </p>

                <p>Act first, think later is a specialty of Adamjkw's that has almost killed the people he drags along with him; though, it is always worth it.</p>
