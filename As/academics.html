He came back to a different junior high for grade 9.
          <br><br>
          It was during this year of homeschooling that Adam worked with a Microbiology prof to hone in his microscope skills and understanding of moder desieses.

        <img src="../images/brain.jpg" alt="brain" width="200px" style="float:left;">Excelling in the IB program at Ross Sheppard High School was his next step where he maintained honour with distinction. His claim to fame their was graduating 8 months early and convincing a teacher to raise his mark by 40% in just a few hours of chit chatting.
          <br><br>
        The next step for Adam is studying Political Science at the University of Alberta. </p>
