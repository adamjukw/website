      <p><img src="../images/tennis.jpg" alt="desiese photo" width="300px" style="float:left; padding:0, 20px,0,20px;">Like just about everyone else Adam started with community soccer.  <br>He has tried just about everything from rowing to basketball. <br>Throughout elementry he played in community level leagues.

        The first sport that Adam commited to was Rugby where he played most of his games for the Clan. Unfortunatley rugby didn't like him as he ended up with 5 concussions in 7 months.

      <img src="../images/hop.jpeg" alt="brain" width="200px" style="float:left;">Realising that his brain was something that he should stop destroying Adam <br>switched his focus to Nordic Racing. He has only been skiing for 2 years and<br> racing for 1. Adam is excited to see where the next season will take him.
