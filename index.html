					<div class="academiatxt"><p>While studying Computer Science and Political Science at the University of Alberta I supplement my schoolwork with an interest in History. Taking part in Highschool Model United Nations I was named Best Delegate in 2021. Through the effective speaking program in Air Cadets I was able to greatly improve my ability to formulate and communicate my ideas. I am in Political Science for the purpose of continuing to develop my ability to think critically, analyze other's ideas and convey my own message(namely writing well). The computer science portion of my degree is there to increase my understanding of computers and software in an age where tech is becoming embedded in everything. Being in both the arts and science faculty at the University of Alberta gives me wide range of access to different courses which is what I want. At this time I see no reason to specialize but rather to learn as much as I can about everything that interests me or appears worthwhile to learn about. I have also enjoyed volunteering with Special Olympics, Edmonton Nordic and various other organizations.</div></p>
