            Adam's academic journey took a relatively normal route until a few weeks into grade 8 where he decided that school was a bit much and he homeschooled the rest of the year. This was a great time for Adam to develop his self-discipline and be creative with his learning.
            <br>
            It was during this year of homeschooling that Adam worked with a Microbiology prof to hone in his microscope skills and understanding of modern diseases.

            Excelling in the IB program at Ross Sheppard High School was his next step where he maintained honours with     distinction. He also enjoyed Model United Nations and band. 
            <br>
            The next step for Adam is studying Political Science at the University of Alberta.
