            <p>This is a visual representation based off a poor understanding of a Monte Carlo Event Generator For The Production and Decay of Proton-Proton Collisions. I have a friend who was working on the experimental physics of this in conjunction with the folks at the Hadron Collider in Geneva. If you would like to view the poster he made to help explain it click <a href="https://www.kennymoc.xyz/" target="_blank" >here</a> and scroll down. <br><br>  DISCLAIMER: This is not scientifically accurate. They(being an ominous term for my friend and physicists in general) don't know precisely what happens when the two protons collide and I generally, have no idea. Also the protons don't bounce around a box they are 'shot' at each other along a horizontal plane(sort-of). </p>
