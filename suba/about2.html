        "By the time you're an adult you'll be half robot" is a joke older people have told me. It is starting to ring a little too true for myself. Which is why I set about on this conquest for SEO glory and internet knowledge.

        I figured what better way to force myself to learn as much as I can about coding, software and the internet (plus the many things I don't know I don't yet know) by building a website and developing it in as many ways as I can. So that is what I am doing. This is my launch pad into a deeper understanding of the online world.

        It will also be an embodyment of myself since the sites functional purpose, at this point is the promotion of ADAMJKW.
        Thanks for taking the time to look around. I hope you enjoy.
