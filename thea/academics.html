            Adam's academic journey took a relatively normal route until a few weeks into grade 8 where he became too      bored with school and skipped the rest of the year. He came back to a different junior high for grade 9.
            <br>
            It was during this year of homeschooling that Adam worked with a Microbiology prof to hone in his microscope skills and understanding of modern diseases.

            Excelling in the IB program at Ross Sheppard High School was his next step where he maintained honour with     distinction. His claim to fame there was once managing to convince a teacher to raise his grade by 40% as well as graduating 8 months early.
            <br>
            The next step for Adam is studying Political Science at the University of Alberta.
