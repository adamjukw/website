                After several consecutive concussions in rugby I needed to switch sports. Cross country skiing was a natural pivot as I used it to train my fitness for rugby already. Having skied a little bit I figured I was a pretty decent skier. My coach who loves nothing more than watching Norwegian technique videos showed me I had a long way to go. The 2022-23 season is my second season racing and I am traveling the country, competing at the highest level in Canada. 
                <br><br>I have enjoyed my training immensely and will continue to train in order to achieve my goals for the 2023-2024 season. 
                <br><br>Home Club: Edmonton Nordic
                <br>Favorite Training Site: Victoria Oval(West loop)
                <br>Best Race of 2023: Canadian Birkebeiner-1st Place (31km)
