              <p>The first sport that Adam committed to was Rugby where he played most of his games for the Clan. Unfortunately rugby didn't like him as he ended up with 5 concussions in 7 months.

              <p>Realising that his brain was something that he should stop destroying Adam switched his focus to Nordic Racing. He has only been skiing for 2 years and racing for 1. Adam is excited to see where the next season took him.
